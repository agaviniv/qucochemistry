    "First, we must load the problem Hamiltonian of which we wish to find the ground state energy. The VQE app in principle can handle an arbitrary Hamiltonian, but for practical reasons we concentrate here on loading a molecular Hamiltonian via the opensource OpenFermion package. \n",
    "The MolecularData() object can be produced using different classical Self-Consistent Field packages, like PySCF, Psi4 etc. In this tutorial, we assume the user has generated a molecular data file in the .hdf5 format which he loads. We also show how to do this for the example case of PySCF, using OpenFermion-PySCF, in another tutorial. In principle you can therefore do end-to-end VQE if you install PySCF, OpenFermion-PySCF, OpenFermion and qucochemistry in the same environment!"
